An "Array Integer" is an integer represented by an array, where each digit of the integer is an element in the array. 
For example, the value 123 (one hundred twenty three) would be stored as follows, note the least significant digit is in the zero-th position.

arrayInt[0] = 3;

arrayInt[1] = 2;

arrayInt[2] = 1;

# incrementNumberArray.py

Implement a method that, given an "ArrayInteger", increments the value by one.

Ex. Given the inputs 123, the result would be

arrayInt[0] = 4;

arrayInt[1] = 2;

arrayInt[2] = 1;

# sumNumberArrays.py

Implement a method that, given an "ArrayInteger", adds another "ArrayInteger".

Ex. Given the inputs 123 and 456 the result would be

arrayInt[0] = 9;

arrayInt[1] = 7;

arrayInt[2] = 5;

# multiplyNumberArrays.py

Implement a method that, given an "ArrayInteger", multiplies another "ArrayInteger". 

Ex. Given the inputs 123 and 3 the result would be:

arrayInt[0] = 9;

arrayInt[1] = 6;

arrayInt[2] = 3;

Restrictions:

CAN NOT CONVERT AN ARRAY INTO A NUMBER AND THEN BACK INTO AN ARRAY. 

THERE MAY BE NO VALUE STORED IN ANY ARRAY GREATER THAN NINE (9).
